# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting Titanic passenger survival using machine learning. The dataset used is based on the famous Titanic Kaggle competition.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. The notebook covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare. It is sourced from Kaggle.

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Titanic-Survival.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Titanic-Survival
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_prediction.ipynb
   ```
